# Appalachian Trail Posters
---

Here are a few graphics I made as a personal project related to the Appalachian Trail! They were primarily created in python Jupyter notebooks, but I also used QGIS and Inkscape for some pre and post processing. Happy trails to all.


## Topo map posters

A quick project to make some decorations for my new apartment/office in NYC. I took data from the USGS on two of my favorite mountains on the AT, Katahdin in ME and Mt. Washington/the presidential range in NH, then made my own stylized topographic maps. I used QGIS for some pre-processing of the data, then Inkscape for the text/prep for printing. Thanks to [Village Copier](http://www.villagecopier.com/) on 118th for accommodating a few printing tests!


Katahdin (I really like the contrast between the tablelands and the [Knife Edge](https://www.hikingme.com/Trails/Highlands/Baxter/KnifeEdge.html)):

Mt. Washington (the whole [Presidential Traverse](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/new-hampshire/presidential-traverse-trail)):

## Hike posters

Following my 2021 northbound AT hike, I made a few graphics illustrating my own experience.
Unfortunately I didn't document my sources for geojson base files, but they were all publically available.

Annotated map. Many many thanks to DSA for collecting a lot of this data and her support throughout the trip.

Daily elevation profiles. It's crazy how low and flat the mid atlantic is compared to the Smokies or the White Mountains. Blank rows were rest days, and the last day represents just the climb up Katahdin without the descent.
